## Notes

- Conservative Party (Tory) voting behaviour was chosen as the dependent variable since it is the main Right Wing party across the whole of Great Britain as opposed to the Left Wing where there are multiple parties (Labour, SNP, Green Party) and large regional discrepancies in Scotland.
- Northern Irish constituencies were excluded from the dataset since they have a different political system to the rest of the UK (none of the main political parties operate there)
- Dec 2019 was used for unemployment data since that is when the election was
- Unemployment Rate is % of  claimants in the constituency as a proportion of the economically active  population aged 16-64.
- House pride data was taken from Dec 2019. There is some missing data in the original dataset which is reflected in the combined dataset
- Health data doesnâ€™t cover every constituency thus was discarded
- Data on ethnic groups is from 2011 (last available census)
- Deprivation Data is from 2019 (england only)
- Home Ownership % is from 2011 (last available census)
