# UK Parliamentary Constituency Classification Model
## Background
This repo represents the work I completed as part of the second half of the DE3 Data Science Module at Imperial College London.

`Python Data Science Practice` contains various code exericses I completed to practice Python Data Manipulation and ML libraries.

`Final Project` contains the code writen for my main project.

## Final Project
As part of the module, I developed a classificaton model, based on the `scikit-learn` library, which predicts whether a UK parliamentary constituency would vote for the Conservative Party or not. This project is purely academic in nature and is not affiliated with any political party or political group.

The model relies on information publically available on the UK parliament website (<https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/type/data-dashboard/>).

The project was also written up as a report, available in this repo.
